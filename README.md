 2. Recursively traversing the binary search tree before, after, and after
 3. Before, after, and after non-recursive traversal of the binary search tree
 4. Sequence traversal binary search tree
 5. Binary search tree leaves
 6. The depth of the binary search tree
 7. The degree of the node of the binary search tree
 8. The parents of the binary search tree and the search of the left and right children
 9. Find a node
 10. Insert a new node
 11. Delete a node
